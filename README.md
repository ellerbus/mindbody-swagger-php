Simple Swagger Code Generator

A stupid simple no nonsense code genertor. If you're looking for robustness, don't have to mess-with-the-codeness, you should probably checkout: http://github.com/mindbody/API-Examples/tree/master/SDKs/PHP/

If you use this, the ReferencedClasses will need to be copied to your project and the 
namespaces fixed appropriately.

```
prompt:> php -f swagger.php
```
